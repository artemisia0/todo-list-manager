# todo-list-manager
Hi! This is my first web application in The Go Programming Language. This is a simple todo list manager (150 LOC).
It might be useful for people learning Go, sqlite3, HTML, CSS.
```bash
go run main.go  # To compile and execute program.
# Now go to browser and type URL 'localhost:8080'.
```
